# Prerequisites

Docker and Node 8.10.0 or greater. 

# Setting up your environment

Before we run Garie lets quickly clone the repo and setup some websites to gather data from.

First clone the project.

```shell
git clone something:url
```

Great now lets add your website's to the list.

## Configure websites

Go into the `garie-config` file and change the urls in the directory.


## Running Garie


Now lets use Docker to start our application.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Everything should compile and now you should have everything running on your machine.
